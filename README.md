# The Simple Oscope GUI

This is the GUI for the Simple Oscope project, a simple PC-based oscilloscope and function generator that uses a 
PSoC device for electrical I/O (http://www.cypress.com/products/32-bit-arm-cortex-m-psoc). 
It was created with Visual Studio Community Edition 2012.

## Notes
At the moment, "master" is far out of date, and "before_1_byte_samples", the default version in this repo
, is the latest version of the project.
